      <h2>What ETHRAEON is</h2>
      <p>
        ETHRAEON is a governance-first layer that sits between your models and your products.
        It gives teams a common set of policies, checks, and audit trails so AI features can be
        deployed with confidence in regulated and brand-sensitive environments.

      <h2>The core loop</h2>
      <ol class="small">
        <li><b>Declare policies</b> (e.g., “no protected-class stereotyping”, “cite sources for medical claims”).</li>
        <li><b>Instrument checks</b> that evaluate model inputs/outputs against those policies.</li>
        <li><b>Decide actions</b> based on risk (allow, redact, request human review, block, escalate).</li>
        <li><b>Log & audit</b> every decision with reasons, so you can explain what happened later.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

      <h2>How the demos map to the framework</h2>
      <ul class="small">
        <li><b>FactPulse</b> — applies checks for misinformation signals and recommends next actions.</li>
        <li><b>Constitutional Bias Dashboard</b> — shows policies, pass/fail, and what would block a release.</li>
        <li><b>Field Triage</b> — routes risky cases (self-harm, data leaks) with governance-safe playbooks.</li>
        <li><b>EcoTrack Pro</b> — demonstrates governance for impact reporting (clear metrics, deltas, auditability).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What “simulated” means here</h2>
      <p class="small">
        These pages use realistic sample data so you can click through the workflows instantly.
        They’re wired exactly like a production setup; swapping in your model, policies, or a database
        is straightforward (see “Make it live” below).
