Subject: Ethraeon Systems â€” Live Demos & Scalable AI Governance

Hi Michiel,

I wanted to share a first look at live demos from Ethraeon Systems. These prototypes show how our Constitutional AI framework works in practice â€” combining transparency, governance, and real-time safeguards into tools you can see and use.

ðŸ”— Live links
- Demo Index â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/
- Framework Explainer â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/demos/constitutional-framework

Why this matters for investors:
- Structured scale: clear path from prototype to enterprise use cases.
- Governance built in: compliance, audits, and reporting are native.
- Strong IP position: architecture is modular and license-ready.

Iâ€™d be happy to walk you through live and discuss what a scalable investment structure could look like.

Best,
Jason
