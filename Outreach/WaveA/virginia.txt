Subject: Ethraeon Systems â€” First Live Demos

Hi Virginia,

Wanted to share a first look at what Iâ€™ve been building. These are live demos of Ethraeon Systemsâ€™ Constitutional AI framework â€” showing how evaluation, governance, and safeguards can run in real-time.

- Framework Explainer â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/demos/constitutional-framework

Itâ€™s still early but already functional. Would love your feedback and thoughts on where it resonates â€” and where it should go next.

Thanks,
Jason
