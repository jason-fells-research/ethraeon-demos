Subject: Ethraeon Systems â€” AI Governance Framework (Live Demos)

Hi Andrea,

Iâ€™m excited to share live demos from Ethraeon Systems. These prototypes show how our Constitutional AI framework operates â€” focused on transparency, governance, and safeguards at enterprise scale.

- Framework Explainer â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/demos/constitutional-framework

Why this matters for compliance and governance:
- Audit-ready reporting is built into the loop.
- Risk visibility makes issues transparent, not hidden.
- Alignment with EU AI Act â€” designed for regulatory clarity.

Iâ€™d be happy to walk through the demos and discuss how this framework could support Casta Divaâ€™s positioning.

Best,
Jason
