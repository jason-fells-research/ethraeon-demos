Subject: Ethraeon Systems — Live Demos + Flutter/MDM follow-up

Hi Mauro,

Following up on our recent conversation: here’s a first look at Ethraeon Systems demos, showing our Constitutional AI framework in action.

- Framework Explainer → https://demos.ethraeon.systems/demos/constitutional-framework

For you, I’d also suggest we touch the MDM demo layer and Flutter app prototype. It’s simple but interactive — something we can iterate quickly together.

This is also a great way to align with your vision for applied tools that enterprise clients can actually “touch” and deploy.

Looking forward to showing you live.

Best,
Jason
