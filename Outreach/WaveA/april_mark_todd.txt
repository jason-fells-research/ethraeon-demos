Subject: Ethraeon Systems â€” Constitutional AI Demos (via April)

Hi April,

As discussed, hereâ€™s a first share package for Mark & Todd. These live demos show Ethraeon Systemsâ€™ Constitutional AI framework in action.

ðŸ”— Live links
- Demo Index â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/
- Framework Explainer â†’ https://demos.ethraeon.systems/demos/constitutional-framework

Why this matters:
- Trust at speed â€” transparent, governed AI loops.
- Cross-domain â€” same system applies from content to compliance to ops.
- Ethical by design â€” practical safeguards for AI at scale.

If theyâ€™d like a live walkthrough, Iâ€™d be happy to arrange it.

Thanks again for bridging this.

Best,
Jason
